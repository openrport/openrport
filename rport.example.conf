[client]
  ## rportd server address.
  ## Mandatory IP address and port divided by a colon.
  server = "0.0.0.0:8080"

  ## list of fallback rportd servers to which the clients tries to connect
  ## if the above "main" server is not reachable.
  #fallback_servers = ["fallback-a.example.com:9090","fallback-b.example.com:80"]
  ## if connected to a fallback server, try every interval to switch back to the main server.
  #server_switchback_interval = '2m'

  ## fingerprint string to perform host-key validation against the server's public key.
  ## Highly recommended. Not using it is a big security risk.
  ## Alternatively, can also be specified via the environment variable RPORT_FINGERPRINT.
  #fingerprint = "36:98:56:12:f3:dc:e5:8d:ac:96:48:23:b6:f0:42:15"

  ## Required client authentication credentials in the form: "<client-auth-id>:<password>".
  ## Alternatively, can also be specified via the environment variable RPORT_AUTH.
  auth = "clientAuth1:1234"

  ## An optional HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS5 proxy which will be used to reach the rport server.
  ## Authentication can be specified inside the URL.
  #proxy = "http://admin:password@my-server.com:8081"

  ## By default rport reads /etc/machine-id (Linux) or the ComputerSystemProduct UUID (Windows)
  ## to get a unique id for the client identification.
  ## NOTE: all history for a client is stored based on this id.
  use_system_id = true
  ## An optional hard-coded client ID to better identify the client.
  ## If not set, a random id will be created that changes on every client start.
  ## That's why it's highly recommended to set it with a value that was generated on the first
  ## start or just set it on the very beginning. So on client restart all his history will be preserved.
  ## The server rejects connections on duplicated ids.
  #id = "5616a70e-81a0-4eec-bab3-0861e3c88334"

  ## By default rport reads the local hostname to identify the system in a human-readable way.
  use_hostname = true
  ## Optionally you can set a hard-coded name for the client.
  ## Useful if you use numeric ids to make client identification easier.
  #name = "my_win_vm_1"

  ## A list of of tags and labels to give your clients attributes maintained in a separate file.
  ## See https://oss.openrport.io/advanced/attributes/
  #attributes_file_path = "/var/lib/rport/client_attributes.(yaml|json|toml)"
  #attributes_file_path = "C:\Program Files\rport\client_attributes.(yaml|json|toml)"
  ## Alternatively you can specify tags with the line below if {attributes_file_path} is not set.
  #tags = ['win', 'server', 'vm']

  ## Optional remote connections tunneled through the server, each of which come in the form:
  ##   <local-port>
  ##   or
  ##   <remote-port>:<local-port>
  ##   or
  ##   <remote-port>:<local-interface>:<local-port>
  ##   Examples:
  ##   1)  remotes = ['22']
  ##       Makes the local port 22 available on a random port of the rport server.
  ##   2)  remotes = ['2222:127.0.0.1:22'] or shorthand
  ##       remotes = ['2222:22']
  ##       Makes the local SSH port 22 available on port 2222 of the rport server.
  ##   3)  remotes = ['9999:192.168.1.1:80']
  ##       Makes the Port 80 of 192.168.1.1 available on port 9999 of the rport server.
  ## sharing <remote-host>:<remote-port> from the client to the server's <local-interface>:<local-port>.
  ## If not set, client connects without active tunnel(s) waiting for tunnels to be initialized by the server.
  ## Multiple remotes must be comma separated. Using linebreaks after the comma is possible.
  #remotes = [
  #  '3389:3389',
  #  '5050'
  #]

  ## By default the rport client can create tunnels to any network address.
  ## This way the so-called "service forwarding" can give access to entire networks.
  ## You can turn service forwarding off so tunnels must end on the local machine.
  #tunnel_allowed = ['127.0.0.0/8']
  ## Alternatively to the above, you can explicitly allow which targets a tunnel is allowed to reach.
  ## By default, no limits are applied
  ## List items can be a single IP or CIDR specification allowing to reach all ports on the target
  ## or an IP address or a CIDR specification and a port separated by a colon.
  ## Using ':<PORT>' without IP address or CIDR is a shorthand for '127.0.0.0/8:<PORT>'
  ## Examples:
  ## Only RDP on localhost can be accessed
  #tunnel_allowed = ['127.0.0.0/8:3389']
  ## Only SSH on localhost and SSH on 192.168.1.1 can be accessed.
  #tunnel_allowed = [':22','192.168.1.1:22']
  ## Only HTTP on localhost, and RDP to any host on the 192.168.1.0/24 network, and all ports on 192.168.1.100 can be accessed.
  #tunnel_allowed = [':80','192.168.1.0/24:3389','192.168.1.100']

  ## There is no technical requirement to run the rport client under the root user.
  ## Running it as root is an unnecessary security risk.
  ## Rport exits with an error if started as root unless you explicitly allow it.
  ## Defaults to false, ignored on Windows.
  #allow_root = false

  ## Supervision and reporting of the pending updates (patch level)
  ## Rport can constantly summarize pending updates and
  ## make that summary available on the rport server.
  ## On Debian/Ubuntu and SuSE Linux sudo rules are needed.
  ## https://oss.openrport.io/advanced/supervising-update-status/
  ## How often after the rport client has started pending updates are summarized
  ## Set 0 to disable.
  ## Supported time units: h (hours), m (minutes)
  ## Default: updates_interval = '4h'
  #updates_interval = '4h'

  ## Inventory of software and containers
  ## Rport can regularly read all installed packages / programs as 
  ## well as running containers (e.g. docker) and transfer them together
  ## to the rport server. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, the rport user 
  ## must be given permission to use the docker daemon.
  ## https://oss.openrport.io/advanced/supervising-system-inventory/
  ## How often should the inventory list be sent to the server after the client starts
  ## Set 0 to disable.
  ## Supported time units: h (hours), m (minutes)
  ## Default: inventory_interval = '4h'
  #inventory_interval = '4h'

  ## An optional param to define a local directory path to store internal data.
  ## By default, "/var/lib/rport" is used on Linux or 'C:\Program Files\rport' on Windows.
  ## On Linux you must create this directory because an unprivileged user
  ## don't have the right to create a directory in /var/lib.
  ## Ideally this directory is the homedir of the rport user and has been created along with the user.
  ## Example: useradd -r -d /var/lib/rport -m -s /bin/false -U -c "System user for rport client and server" rport
  #data_dir = "/var/lib/rport"

  ## An optional param specifying the local interface to be used for connecting to the server.
  #bind_interface = "eth0"

  ## Determine the clients' external ipv4 and ipv6 addresses by fetching an API.
  ## See https://oss.openrport.io/advanced/ip-address-determination/
  #ip_api_url = "https://myip.openrport.io"
  ## How often (in minutes) to refresh external IP addresses, default 30
  #ip_refresh_min = 30

[connection]
  ## An optional keepalive interval. The client will send ping request at this interval.
  ## You must specify a time with a unit, for example '30s' or '2m'.
  ## Defaults to '3m', '0s' = disabled
  #keep_alive = '3m'

  ## Timout for the above keep_alive after which the connections is considered disconnected.
  ## You must specify a time with a unit, for example '30s' or '2m'.
  ## Defaults to '30s'
  #keep_alive_timeout = '30s'

  ## Maximum number of times to retry before exiting. Defaults to unlimited (-1)
  #max_retry_count = 10

  ## Maximum wait time before retrying after a disconnection. Defaults to 5 minutes
  #max_retry_interval = '5m'

  ## Write a state file to {data_dir}/state.json that can be evaluated by external watchdog implementations.
  ## On Linux this also enables the systemd watchdog integration by using the systemd notify socket.
  ## Requires max_retry_count = -1 and keep_alive > 0
  ## Read more https://oss.openrport.io/advanced/watchdog-integration/
  ## Disabled by default.
  #watchdog_integration = false

  ## Optionally set the 'Host' header. Defaults to the host found in the server url
  #hostname = "myvm1.lan"

  ## Other custom headers in the form "HeaderName: HeaderContent"
  #headers = ['User-Agent: test1', 'Authorization: Basic XXXXXX']

[logging]
  ## Specifies log file path for global logging.
  ## Not setting "log_file" turns logging off.
  #log_file = 'C:\Program Files\rport\rport.log'
  log_file = "/var/log/rport/rport.log"

  ## Specify log level. Values: 'error', 'info', 'debug'.
  ## Defaults to 'info'
  #log_level = "info"

[remote-commands]
  ## Enable or disable execution of remote commands sent by server.
  ## Defaults: true
  #enabled = true

  ## Limit the maximum length of the command or script output that is sent back to server.
  ## Applies to the stdout and stderr separately.
  ## If exceeded {send_back_limit} bytes are sent.
  ## Defaults: 4M
  #send_back_limit = 4194304

  ## Allow commands matching the following regular expressions.
  ## The filter is applied to the command sent. Full path must be used.
  ## See {order} parameter for more details how it's applied together with {deny}.
  ## Defaults: ['^/usr/bin/.*','^/usr/local/bin/.*','^C:\\Windows\\System32\\.*']
  #allow = ['^/usr/bin/.*','^/usr/local/bin/.*','^C:\\Windows\\System32\\.*']

  ## Deny commands matching one of the following regular expressions.
  ## The filter is applied to the command sent. Full path must be used.
  ## See {order} parameter for more details how it's applied together with {allow}.
  ## With the below default filter only single commands are allowed.
  ## Defaults: ['(\||<|>|;|,|\n|&)']
  #deny = ['(\||<|>|;|,|\n|&)']

  ## Order: ['allow','deny'] or ['deny','allow']. Order of which filter is applied first.
  ## Defaults: ['allow','deny']
  ##
  ## order: ['allow','deny']
  ## First, all allow directives are evaluated; at least one must match, or the command is rejected.
  ## Next, all deny directives are evaluated. If any matches, the command is rejected.
  ## Last, any commands which do not match an allow or a deny directive are denied by default.
  ## Example:
  ## allow: ['^/usr/bin/.*']
  ## deny: ['^/usr/bin/zip']
  ## All commands in /usr/bin except '/usr/bin/zip' can be executed. Full path must be used.
  ##
  ## order: ['deny','allow']
  ## First, all deny directives are evaluated; if any match,
  ## the command is denied UNLESS it also matches an allow directive.
  ## Any command which do not match any allow or deny directives are permitted.
  ## Example:
  ## deny: ['.*']
  ## allow: ['zip$']
  ## All commands are denied except those ending in zip.
  ##
  #order = ['allow','deny']

[remote-scripts]
  ## Enable or disable execution of remote scripts sent by server.
  ## Defaults: false
  #enabled = false

[monitoring]
  ## The rport client can collect and report performance data of the operating system.
  ## https://oss.openrport.io/advanced/monitoring/
  ## Monitoring is enabled by default
  enabled = true

  ## How often (seconds) monitoring data should be collected.
  ## A value below 60 seconds will be overwritten by the hard-coded default of 60 seconds.
  #interval = 60

  ## RPort monitors the fill level of almost all volumes or mount points.
  ## Change the below defaults to include or exclude volumes or mount points from the monitoring.
  #fs_type_include = ['ext3','ext4','xfs','jfs','ntfs','btrfs','hfs','apfs','exfat','smbfs','nfs']

  ## List of excluded mount points or device letters
  ## Example:
  # fs_path_exclude = ['/mnt/*','h:']
  #fs_path_exclude = []

  ## Having fs_path_exclude_recurse = false the specified path
  ## must match a mountpoint or it will be ignored
  ## Having fs_path_exclude_recurse = true the specified path
  ## can be any folder and all mountpoints underneath will be excluded
  #fs_path_exclude_recurse = false

  ## To avoid monitoring of so-called mount binds,
  ## mount points are identified by the path and device name.
  ## Mountpoints pointing to the same device are ignored.
  ## What appears first in /proc/self/mountinfo is considered as the original.
  ## Applies only to Linux
  #fs_identify_mountpoints_by_device = true

  ## RPort monitors all running processes
  ## Process monitoring is enabled by default
  pm_enabled = true

  ## Monitor kernel tasks identified by process group 0
  #pm_enable_kerneltask_monitoring = true

  ## The process list is sorted by PID descending. Only the top N processes are monitored.
  #pm_max_number_monitored_processes = 500

  ## Monitor the bandwidth usage of the following maximum two network cards:
  ## 'net_lan' and 'net_wan'.
  ## You must specify the device name and the maximum speed in Megabits.
  ## On Windows use 'Get-Netadapter' to discover adapter names.
  ## Examples:
  ## net_lan = [ 'eth0' , '1000' ]
  ## net_wan = ['Ethernet0', '1000']
  #net_lan = ['', '1000']
  #net_wan = ['', '1000']

[interpreter-aliases]
  ## For fast and unified script execution with different interpreters and shells,
  ## you can specify aliases. Instead of providing the full path to the shell,
  ## sending the alias is sufficient.
  ## https://oss.openrport.io/get-started/scripts/#customizing-an-interpreter
  ## Optionally you can also specify input and output encoding.
  ## If only one encoding is specified it will be used for both input and output.
  ## Examples:
  # pwsh7 = 'C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe'
  # pwsh7enc = ['C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe', 'windows-1252', 'cp437']
  # bash = 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe'

[file-reception]
  ## Receive files pushed by the server, enabled by default
  # enabled = true
  ## The rport client will reject writing files to any of the following folders and its sub folders.
  ## https://oss.openrport.io/advanced/file-reception/
  ## Wildcards (glob) are supported.
  ## Linux defaults
  # protected = ['/bin', '/sbin', '/boot', '/usr/bin', '/usr/sbin', '/dev', '/lib*', '/run']
  ## Windows defaults
  # protected = ['C:\Windows\', 'C:\ProgramData']
