[client]
## rportd server address.
## Mandatory IP address and port divided by a colon.
server = "0.0.0.0:8080"

## list of fallback rportd servers to which the clients tries to connect
## if the above "main" server is not reachable.
#fallback_servers = ["fallback-a.example.com:9090","fallback-b.example.com:80"]
## if connected to a fallback server, try every interval to switch back to the main server.
#server_switchback_interval = '2m'

## fingerprint string to perform host-key validation against the server's public key.
## Highly recommended. Not using it is a big security risk.
#fingerprint = "36:98:56:12:f3:dc:e5:8d:ac:96:48:23:b6:f0:42:15"

## Required client authentication credentials in the form: "<client-auth-id>:<password>".
auth = "clientAuth1:1234"

## An optional HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS5 proxy which will be used to reach the rport server.
## Authentication can be specified inside the URL.
#proxy = "http://admin:password@my-server.com:8081"

## By default rport reads /etc/machine-id (Linux) or the ComputerSystemProduct UUID (Windows)
## to get a unique id for the client identification.
## NOTE: all history for a client is stored based on this id.
use_system_id = true
## An optional hard-coded client ID to better identify the client.
## If not set, a random id will be created that changes on every client start.
## That's why it's highly recommended to set it with a value that was generated on the first
## start or just set it on the very beginning. So on client restart all his history will be preserved.
## The server rejects connections on duplicated ids.
#id = "5616a70e-81a0-4eec-bab3-0861e3c88334"

## By default rport reads the local hostname to identify the system in a human-readable way.
use_hostname = true
## Optionally you can set a hard-coded name for the client.
## Useful if you use numeric ids to make client identification easier.
#name = "my_win_vm_1"

## An optional list of tags to give your clients attributes.
## Used for filtering clients on the server.
#tags = ['win', 'server', 'vm']

## Optional remote connections tunneled through the server, each of which come in the form:
##   <local-port>
##   or
##   <remote-port>:<local-port>
##   or
##   <remote-port>:<local-interface>:<local-port>
##   Examples:
##   1)  remotes = ['22']
##       Makes the local port 22 available on a random port of the rport server.
##   2)  remotes = ['2222:127.0.0.1:22'] or shorthand
##       remotes = ['2222:22']
##       Makes the local SSH port 22 available on port 2222 of the rport server.
##   3)  remotes = ['9999:192.168.1.1:80']
##       Makes the Port 80 of 192.168.1.1 available on port 9999 of the rport server.
## sharing <remote-host>:<remote-port> from the client to the server's <local-interface>:<local-port>.
## If not set, client connects without active tunnel(s) waiting for tunnels to be initialized by the server.
## Multiple remotes must be comma separated. Using linebreaks after the comma is possible.
#remotes = [
#  '3389:3389',
#  '5050'
#]

## There is no technical requirement to run the rport client under the root user.
## Running it as root is an unnecessary security risk.
## Rport exits with an error if started as root unless you explicitly allow it.
## Defaults to false, ignored on Windows.
#allow_root = false

## Supervision and reporting of the pending updates (patch level)
## Rport can constantly summarize pending updates and
## make that summary available on the rport server.
## On Debian/Ubuntu and SuSE Linux sudo rules are needed.
## https://oss.rport.io/docs/no16-update-status.html
## How often after the rport client has started pending updates are summarized
## Set 0 to disable.
## Supported time units: h (hours), m (minutes)
## Default: updates_interval = '4h'
#updates_interval = '4h'

## An optional param to define a local directory path to store internal data.
## By default, "/var/lib/rport" is used on Linux or 'C:\Program Files\rport' on Windows.
## On Linux you must create this directory because an unprivileged user
## don't have the right to create a directory in /var/lib.
## Ideally this directory is the homedir of the rport user and has been created along with the user.
## Example: useradd -r -d /var/lib/rport -m -s /bin/false -U -c "System user for rport client and server" rport
#data_dir = "/var/lib/rport"

[connection]
  ## An optional keepalive interval. You must specify a time with a unit, for example '30s' or '2m'.
  ## Defaults to '0s' (disabled)
  keep_alive = '30s'

  ## Maximum number of times to retry before exiting. Defaults to unlimited (-1)
  #max_retry_count = 10

  ## Maximum wait time before retrying after a disconnection. Defaults to 5 minutes
  max_retry_interval = '5m'

  ## Optionally set the 'Host' header. Defaults to the host found in the server url
  #hostname = "myvm1.lan"

  ## Other custom headers in the form "HeaderName: HeaderContent"
  #headers = ['User-Agent: test1', 'Authorization: Basic XXXXXX']

[logging]
  ## Specifies log file path for global logging.
  ## Not setting "log_file" turns logging off.
  #log_file = 'C:\Program Files\rport\rport.log'
  log_file = "/var/log/rport/rport.log"

  ## Specify log level. Values: 'error', 'info', 'debug'.
  ## Defaults to 'error'
  log_level = "error"

[remote-commands]
  ## Enable or disable execution of remote commands sent by server.
  ## Defaults: true
  #enabled = true

  ## Limit the maximum length of the command or script output that is sent back to server.
  ## Applies to the stdout and stderr separately.
  ## If exceeded {send_back_limit} bytes are sent.
  ## Defaults: 4M
  #send_back_limit = 4194304

  ## Allow commands matching the following regular expressions.
  ## The filter is applied to the command sent. Full path must be used.
  ## See {order} parameter for more details how it's applied together with {deny}.
  ## Defaults: ['^/usr/bin/.*','^/usr/local/bin/.*','^C:\\Windows\\System32\\.*']
  #allow = ['^/usr/bin/.*','^/usr/local/bin/.*','^C:\\Windows\\System32\\.*']

  ## Deny commands matching one of the following regular expressions.
  ## The filter is applied to the command sent. Full path must be used.
  ## See {order} parameter for more details how it's applied together with {allow}.
  ## With the below default filter only single commands are allowed.
  ## Defaults: ['(\||<|>|;|,|\n|&)']
  #deny = ['(\||<|>|;|,|\n|&)']

  ## Order: ['allow','deny'] or ['deny','allow']. Order of which filter is applied first.
  ## Defaults: ['allow','deny']
  ##
  ## order: ['allow','deny']
  ## First, all allow directives are evaluated; at least one must match, or the command is rejected.
  ## Next, all deny directives are evaluated. If any matches, the command is rejected.
  ## Last, any commands which do not match an allow or a deny directive are denied by default.
  ## Example:
  ## allow: ['^/usr/bin/.*']
  ## deny: ['^/usr/bin/zip']
  ## All commands in /usr/bin except '/usr/bin/zip' can be executed. Full path must be used.
  ##
  ## order: ['deny','allow']
  ## First, all deny directives are evaluated; if any match,
  ## the command is denied UNLESS it also matches an allow directive.
  ## Any command which do not match any allow or deny directives are permitted.
  ## Example:
  ## deny: ['.*']
  ## allow: ['zip$']
  ## All commands are denied except those ending in zip.
  ##
  #order = ['allow','deny']

[remote-scripts]
  ## Enable or disable execution of remote scripts sent by server.
  ## Defaults: false
  #enabled = false

[monitoring]
  ## The rport client can collect and report performance data of the operating system.
  ## https://oss.rport.io/docs/no17-monitoring.html
  ## Monitoring is enabled by default
  enabled = true

  ## How often (seconds) monitoring data should be collected.
  ## A value below 60 seconds will be overwritten by the hard-coded default of 60 seconds.
  #interval = 60

  ## RPort monitors the fill level of almost all volumes or mount points.
  ## Change the below defaults to include or exclude volumes or mount points from the monitoring.
  #fs_type_include = ['ext3','ext4','xfs','jfs','ntfs','btrfs','hfs','apfs','exfat','smbfs','nfs']

  ## List of excluded mount points or device letters
  ## Example:
  # fs_path_exclude = ['/mnt/*','h:']
  #fs_path_exclude = []

  ## Having fs_path_exclude_recurse = false the specified path
  ## must match a mountpoint or it will be ignored
  ## Having fs_path_exclude_recurse = true the specified path
  ## can be any folder and all mountpoints underneath will be excluded
  #fs_path_exclude_recurse = false

  ## To avoid monitoring of so-called mount binds,
  ## mount points are identified by the path and device name.
  ## Mountpoints pointing to the same device are ignored.
  ## What appears first in /proc/self/mountinfo is considered as the original.
  ## Applies only to Linux
  #fs_identify_mountpoints_by_device = true

  ## RPort monitors all running processes
  ## Process monitoring is enabled by default
  pm_enabled = true

  ## Monitor kernel tasks identified by process group 0
  #pm_enable_kerneltask_monitoring = true

  ## The process list is sorted by PID descending. Only the top N processes are monitored.
  #pm_max_number_monitored_processes = 500

  ## Monitor the bandwidth usage of the following maximum two network cards:
  ## 'net_lan' and 'net_wan'.
  ## You must specify the device name and the maximum speed in Megabits.
  ## On Windows use 'Get-Netadapter' to discover adapter names.
  ## Examples:
  ## net_lan = [ 'eth0' , 1000 ]
  ## net_wan = ['Ethernet0', 1000]
  #net_lan = ['', 1000]
  #net_wan = ['', 1000]

[file-push]
  ## The rport client will reject writing files to any of the following folders and its subfolders.
  ## wildcards (glob) are supported.
  ## Linux defaults
  # file_push_deny = ['/bin', '/sbin', '/boot', '/usr/bin', '/usr/sbin', '/dev', '/lib*', '/run']
  ## Windows defaults
  # file_push_deny = ['C:\Windows\', 'C:\ProgramData']
