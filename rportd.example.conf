[server]
  ## Defines the IP address and port the HTTP server listens on.
  ## This is where the rport clients connect to.
  ## Defaults: "0.0.0.0:8080"
  #address = "0.0.0.0:8080"

  ## Optionally defines full client connect URL.
  ## Defaults to http://{address}
  ## This setting is only used to return via an API call where rportd is listening for connections.
  ## Useful, if you run the rportd behind a reverse proxy and the external URL differs from the internal address and port
  #url = "http://example.com"

  ## An optional string to seed the generation of a ECDSA public and private key pair.
  ## Highly recommended. Not using it is a big security risk.
  ## Use "openssl rand -hex 18" to generate a secure key seed
  key_seed = "5448e69530b4b97fb510f96ff1550500b093"

  ## An optional string representing a single client with full access, in the form of <client-id>:<password>.
  ## This is equivalent to creating an {auth_file} with '{"<client-id>":"<password>"}'.
  ## Use either {auth_file}/{auth_table} or {auth}. Not both.
  ## If multiple auth options are enabled, rportd exits with an error.
  auth = "user1:1234"

  ## An optional path to a json file with client credentials.
  ## This is for authentication of the rport tunnel clients.
  ## The file should contain a map with clients credentials defined like:
  ## {
  ##   "<client1-id>": "<password1>",
  ##   "<client2-id>": "<password2>"
  ## }
  ## Use either {auth_file}/{auth_table} or {auth}. Not both.
  ## If multiple auth options are enabled, rportd exits with an error.
  #auth_file = "/var/lib/rport/client-auth.json"

  ## An optional name of a database table for client authentication.
  ## Requires a global database connection. See below.
  ## The table must be created manually.
  ## Learn how to create them https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/rport/blob/master/docs/client-auth.md#database
  #auth_table = "clients_auth"

  ## When using an {auth_file} or a database table creating separate credentials for each client is recommended.
  ## It increases security because you can lock out clients individually.
  ## If {auth_multiuse_creds} is false a client is rejected if another client with the same username is connected
  ## or has been connected within the {keep_lost_clients} interval.
  ## Defaults: true
  #auth_multiuse_creds = true

  ## Having set {auth_multiuse_creds} = false, you can omit specifying a client-id.
  ## You can us the authentication username as client-id to slim down the client configuration
  ## Defaults: false
  #equate_authusername_clientid = false

  ## If you want to delegate the creation and maintenance to an external tool
  ## you should turn {auth_write} off.
  ## The API will reject all writing access to the client auth with HTTP 403.
  ## Applies only to {auth_file} and {auth_table}
  ## Default: true
  #auth_write = true

  ## Specifies another HTTP server to proxy requests to when rportd receives a normal HTTP request
  #proxy = "http://intranet.lan:8080/"

  ## Defines a list of port numbers or ranges of server ports,
  ## that would not be used for automatic port assignment.
  ## Defaults to ['1-1024'].
  ## If all ports should be used then set to "[]".
  excluded_ports = [
    '1-1024',
    '8888',
    '8080'
  ]

  ## An optional param to define a local directory path to store internal data.
  ## By default, "/var/lib/rport" is used on Linux, 'C:\ProgramData\rport' is used on Windows.
  ## If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.
  ## On Linux you must create this directory because an unprivileged user
  ## don't have the right to create a directory in /var/lib.
  ## Ideally this directory is the homedir of the rport user and has been created along with the user.
  ## Example: useradd -r -d /var/lib/rport -m -s /bin/false -U -c "System user for rport client and server" rport
  #data_dir = 'C:\ProgramData\rport'
  #data_dir = "/var/lib/rport"

  ## An optional param to define a duration to keep info (clients, tunnels, etc) about active and disconnected clients.
  ## By default is "1h". To disable it set it to "0". It can contain "h"(hours), "m"(minutes), "s"(seconds).
  #keep_lost_clients = "1h"

  ## Applicable only if {keep_lost_clients} is specified. An optional param to define an interval
  ## to flush info (clients, tunnels, etc) about active and disconnected clients to disk.
  ## By default, 1 second is used. It can contain "h"(hours), "m"(minutes), "s"(seconds).
  #save_clients_interval = "5s"

  ## Applicable only if {keep_lost_clients} is specified. An optional param to define an
  ## interval to clean up internal storage from obsolete disconnected clients.
  ## By default, 3 seconds is used. It can contain "h"(hours), "m"(minutes), "s"(seconds).
  #cleanup-clients-interval = "5s"

  ## An optional param to define a limit for data that can be sent by rport clients and API requests.
  ## By default is set to 2048(2Kb).
  #max_request_bytes = 2048

  ## An optional param to define a timeout in seconds to observe the remote command execution.
  ## Defaults: 60.
  #run_remote_cmd_timeout_sec = 60

  ## An optional param to define a timeout to check whether a remote destination of a requested new tunnel is available,
  ## i.e. whether a given remote port is open on a client machine. By default, "2s" is used.
  #check_port_timeout = "1s"

  ## There is no technical requirement to run the rport server under the root user.
  ## Running it as root is an unnecessary security risk.
  ## You don't even need root-rights to run rport on tcp ports below 1024.
  ## Use "setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip /usr/local/bin/rportd" to allow the usage of any tcp ports.
  ## Hint: setcap must be applied after each update of the binary.
  ##       Consider integrating it into the systemd service file as an ExecStartPre option.
  ## Rport exits with an error if started as root unless you explicitly allow it.
  ## Defaults to false, ignored on Windows.
  #allow_root = false

  ## NOTE: THIS OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE YET
  ## Multi-tenancy
  ## Rport server can isolate clients and users from different tenants.
  ## Visit https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/rport/blob/master/docs/multi-tenancy.md
  ## Requires auth_table, auth_user_table, auth_group_table.
  ## Defaults to false.
  #multi_tenancy = false

[logging]
  ## Specifies log file path for global logging
  ## Not setting {log_file} turns logging off.
  log_file = "/var/log/rport/rportd.log"

  ## Specify log level. Values: 'error', 'info', 'debug'.
  ## Defaults to 'error'
  log_level = "error"

  ## NOTE: THIS OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE YET
  ## Specifies a log file path or database table for audit logging
  ## The audit log contains sensitive data about all users and their actions.
  ## Who has created a tunnel or executed a command when on which system(s)?
  ## It is your duty, to keep the file tidy, for example by using logrotate.
  ## Not setting {audit_log_file} or {audit_log_table} turns audit logging off.
  ## On conflicting settings rportd exits with an error.
  #audit_log_file = "/var/log/rport/rportd-audit.log"

  ## NOTE: THIS OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE YET
  ## An optional name of a database table to store the audit log.
  ## Requires a global database connection. See below.
  ## It is your duty, to keep the table tidy, for example by creating a cron.
  ## An example can be found here https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/rport/blob/master/docs/logging.md#database
  ## Not setting {audit_log_file} or {audit_log_table} turns audit logging off.
  #audit_log_table = "audit_log"

[api]
  ## Defines the IP address and port the API server listens on
  ## specify non-empty {address} to enable API support
  address = "127.0.0.1:3000"

  ## Defines <user:password> authentication pair for accessing the API. Enables access for a single user.
  ## Learn more about api auth options and get examples
  ## https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/rport/blob/master/docs/api-auth.md
  ## Use either {auth_file}/{auth_user_table} or {auth}. Not both.
  ## If multiple auth options are enabled, rportd exits with an error.
  auth = "admin:foobaz"

  ## Use a json file containing users, passwords and groups.
  ## Passwords are expected to be bcrypt encoded.
  ## Learn more about api auth options and get examples
  ## https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/rport/blob/master/docs/api-auth.md
  ## Use either {auth_file}/{auth_user_table} or {auth}. Not both.
  ## If multiple auth options are enabled, rportd exits with an error.
  #auth_file = 'C:\Program Files\rport\api-auth.json'
  #auth_file = "/var/lib/rport/api-auth.json"

  ## An optional name of two database tables for api user authentication.
  ## Requires a global database connection. See below.
  ## Tables must be created manually.
  ## Learn how to create them https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/rport/blob/master/docs/api-auth.md#database
  #auth_user_table = "users"
  #auth_group_table = "groups"

  ## Defines JWT secret used to generate new tokens
  jwt_secret = "quei1too2Jae3xootu"

  ## If specified, rportd will serve static files from this directory on the same API address.
  ## This is the place where the frontend files (html/js) go.
  ## Learn how to install the frontend https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/rport/blob/master/docs/frontend.md
  #doc_root = 'C:\Program Files\rport\docroot'
  #doc_root = "/var/lib/rport/docroot"

  ## If both cert_file and key_file are specified, then rportd will use them to serve the API with https.
  ## Intermediate certificates should be included in cert_file if required.
  #cert_file = "/var/lib/rport/server.crt"
  #key_file = "/var/lib/rport/server.key"

  ## Specifies file for API access logs. Logs will be written in Combined Log Format.
  ## If this is not set the API access logs are disabled.
  #access_log_file = 'C:\Program Files\rport\api-access.log'
  #access_log_file = "/var/log/rport/api-access.log"

[database]
  ## Global configuration of a database connection.
  ## The database and the initial schema must be created manually.
  ## Learn how to use a database:
  ##  for api auth: https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/rport/blob/master/docs/api-auth.md#database
  ##  for clients auth:  https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/rport/blob/master/docs/client-auth.md#database
