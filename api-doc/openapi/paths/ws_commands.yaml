  summary: Web Socket Connection to execute a remote command on rport client(s)

    NOTE: swagger is not designed to document WebSocket API. This is a temporary solution.

    A new web socket is created for each new request to execute a remote command
    on rport client(s).
     Steps:
     1. To pass authentication - include "access_token" param into the url. The value is a jwt token that is created by 'login' API endpoint.
     2. Upgrades the current connection to Web Socket.
     3. Then server waits for an inbound message from UI client. It should be a JSON object `ExecuteCmdRequest`(see in 'Models')
     For example,
       ```json
       {
         "command": "/usr/bin/whoami",
         "client_ids": [ "qa-lin-debian9", "qa-lin-debian10", "qa-lin-centos8", "qa-lin-ubuntu18", "qa-lin-ubuntu16" ],
         "group_ids": [ "group-1"],
         "timeout_sec": 30,
         "cwd": "/root",
         "execute_concurrently": true,
         "is_sudo": true
       }
       ```
     4. Validates the inbound msg. If it fails - server sends an outbound JSON message `ErrorPayload`(see in 'Models') and closes the connection.
     5. Server sends a given command to rport client(s) to execute.
     6. As soon as it gets a result from each rport client - it sends an outbound JSON message `Job`(see in 'Models').
     It can contain a non-empty 'error' field if server wasn't able to send the command to the rport client.
     Number of outbound messages is expected to be as many as rport clients. Or less if it's not a concurrent mode and 'abort_on_error' is turned on.
     7. As soon as all rport clients send back the result - the connection is closed by server.
     8. Also, a current connection can be closed by UI client.

    There is a simple UI for testing. Try it out on http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/test/commands/ui.
