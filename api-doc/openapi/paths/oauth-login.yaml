    * This API is only enabled if the Rport Plus plugin is loaded and running. For
    more information, see [Rport Plus](https://oss.rport.io/docs/no25-plus-introduction.html).

    * It allows an authorization code (`code`) returned by an OAuth provider
    callback to be used to login and obtain an Rport Authorization JWT Token. The
    `state` parameter also received in the callback must also be provided and
    will be validated by the Rport server.

    * Note that security will be increased if clients verify that the `state`
    parameter returned in the callback matches the `state` parameter supplied
    initially as part of the OAuth `authorize` url. To obtain an `authorize`
    url, the Rport `/auth/ext/settings` endpoint must be called. It will return
    two additional APIs that can be used to perform OAuth based logins.
